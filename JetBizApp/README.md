This is a simple mock app for understanding the basics of Jetpack Compose framework.

What the app do is basically showing a list of project when you click the button named "portfolio". 



The instructor uses material 2 however, material 2 api is deprecated and material 3 is being used now. So I had to change many things in the code accordingly with material 3 api structure with googling it which makes the course progress more fun actually.
